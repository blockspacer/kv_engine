 *
 *     // Create a ProcessTracker with a deadline of 10ms from now.
 *     ProgressTracker tracker;
 *     tracker.setDeadline(ProcessClock::now + std::chrono::milliseconds(10));

 *     // Loop doing some work; where you want to stop after some time limit.
 *     for (size_t ii = 0; ii < ...; ii++) {
 *         doSomeWork();
 *         if (tracker.shouldContinueVisiting(ii)) {
